#### Why!
----------
I wanted to learn MongoDB. I've been used to using a relational database and wanted to practice working with a NoSQL database. I also wanted to practice writing more tests.
This of course came with some tradeoffs. It meant a slower development speed than what I'd been used to.

# Stretch Goals
